# ProjectWork_RobotFramework
This is the final version of the school projectwork for Testing / robotics tool module.

In the project I was asked to write specific tests for a vaalikone website but also design additional test cases.
 
The project uses the Selenium Library to automate browser functionality - things such as : clicking a radio button, selecting a text field, etc. 

If the project doesn't load in Github use this link to view it on nbviewer.
