# ProjectWork_RobotFramework
This is the final version of the school projectwork for Testing / robotics tool module. (both files are the same but the ipynb contains logs + images)

In the project I was asked to write specific tests and web automation for a vaalikone website but also design additional test cases.
 
The project uses the Selenium Library to automate browser functionality - things such as : clicking a radio button, selecting a text field, etc. 

If the project .ipynb doesn't load in Github use this link to view it on nbviewer.
